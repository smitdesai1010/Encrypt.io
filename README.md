# Encrypt.io
To tackle the increasing cyber threats and data-breaches, Encrypt.io is a File-encryption application which can be used to safely encrypt-and-decrypt files

The application prompts the user to upload the file that has to encrypted and a passowrd.
Based upon the password entered by the user, the application will generate multiple passcodes.
Finally, it will use a series of combinations of different passcode and binary operations to encrypt the file.
The same procedure will go for decrypting a file.

Hence the application adds a additional layer of security on top of the user determined password.
To decrypt the file, a third party user will need the password and the application itself to generate the same sequence of passcode and binary operations.
